Repo for coronavirus / viral spread detection use case files

Our proposal for adapting our tracking methods to address this problem for CDC and the general public welfare can be found here. Adder's goal here is to measure the spread of COVID-19 'Coronavirus' using our location data, compared with known locations where outbreaks have occurred.

Additional iterations could involve adapting our vehicle tracking application for general public use.
